# Git Training CLI Application - User Stories and Sprint Planning

## Product Vision
A command-line interface application that teaches Git and GitHub fundamentals through interactive learning modules, practical command execution, and progressive skill development in a controlled environment.

## Product Backlog by Epic

### EPIC A: Core Navigation and User Interface
- **A1**: As a user, I want to launch the application and view a list of available learning modules with their respective difficulty levels and completion status.
- **A2**: As a user, I want to resume my previous session and continue from where I left off in my learning progression.
- **A3**: As a user, I want to access configuration options to customize the learning experience including difficulty filters and display preferences.

### EPIC B: Learning Module Structure and Progression
- **B4**: As a user, I want to view detailed information about each learning module including objectives, required commands, and expected outcomes.
- **B5**: As a user, I want to progress through structured learning tasks with clear completion indicators and progress tracking.
- **B6**: As a user, I want to access contextual help and hints when encountering difficulties during task execution.
- **B7**: As a user, I want to earn experience points, achieve skill levels, and unlock achievement badges to track my learning progress.

### EPIC C: Command Validation and Git Integration
- **C8**: As a user, I want the application to validate my Git command execution in real-time to ensure proper learning and immediate feedback.
- **C9**: As a user, I want to work within isolated sandbox repositories for each learning module to practice commands safely.
- **C10**: As a user, I want to view command demonstrations and examples before attempting to execute them independently.

### EPIC D: Data Persistence and Session Management
- **D11**: As a user, I want my learning progress automatically saved locally to maintain continuity across sessions .


### EPIC E: Content Management and Authoring
- **E13**: As a content author, I want to define learning modules using structured configuration files (JSON) for maintainability.

### Risk Mitigation for Agile Timeline
- **Scope Risk**: Clearly defined MVP with "nice-to-have" features identified for deferral
- **Technical Risk**: Use proven frameworks and libraries to minimize implementation risk
- **Team Risk**: Pair programming for knowledge sharing, daily standups for communication
- **Quality Risk**: Continuous integration of features, sprint reviews for early feedback
- **Timeline Risk**: 2-day sprint cycles allow for quick course correction and re-prioritization

## Technical Architecture and Implementation Strategy (One-Week Focus)

### Architecture Decisions (Optimized for Speed)
- **Language**: Node.js with minimal dependencies for rapid development
- **CLI Framework**: Commander.js + Inquirer.js for interactive menus
- **Testing**: Manual testing with basic error handling (automated tests deferred)
- **Configuration**: Hardcoded modules initially, JSON config files for future
- **Git Integration**: Simple `child_process.exec()` calls with output parsing
- **State Management**: JSON file persistence with basic backup

### One-Week Development Stack
- **Core**: Node.js 18+ with ES modules
- **CLI Libraries**: `commander`, `inquirer`, `chalk` (for colors)
- **File Operations**: Native `fs` module with `fs/promises`
- **Git Commands**: Native git CLI via `child_process`
- **Data Storage**: JSON files in user's home directory

### Risk Mitigation (One-Week Timeline)
- **Technical Risk**: Use battle-tested npm packages instead of custom implementations
  - *Mitigation*: Commander.js for CLI, Inquirer.js for interactions
- **Scope Creep Risk**: Strict feature prioritization with MVP focus
  - *Mitigation*: Daily feature freeze decisions, "must-have" vs "nice-to-have" classification
- **Integration Risk**: Simple architecture with minimal dependencies
  - *Mitigation*: Monolithic structure, avoid microservices complexity
- **Time Risk**: Aggressive timeline with buffer for polish
  - *Mitigation*: Daily progress check-ins, pair programming for blockers

### Success Metrics (MVP Definition)
- **Functional**: User can complete 3 Git learning modules end-to-end
- **Educational**: Command demonstrations are clear and helpful
- **Technical**: Application starts in <3 seconds, handles errors gracefully
- **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation, clear progress indicators
- **Delivery**: Working demo ready by Monday morning with documentation
