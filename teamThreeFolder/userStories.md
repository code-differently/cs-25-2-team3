# Git Training CLI Application - User Stories and Sprint Planning

## Product Vision
A command-line interface application that teaches Git and GitHub fundamentals through interactive learning modules, practical command execution, and progressive skill development in a controlled environment.

## Definition of Done (Adjusted for One-Week Timeline)
- Feature implementation completed and basic functionality verified
- Core functionality manually tested and validated
- Basic documentation updated (CLI help, README with usage examples)
- Code committed to main branch
- Application can be launched and demonstrates key learning features

## Scrum Sprint Planning and Delivery Strategy
**Project Timeline**: September 15-22, 2025 (Due: Monday, September 22)
**Sprint Duration**: 2 days each | **Team Capacity**: Adjusted for academic project timeline

## User Stories
- **User Story 1**: As a user, I want to launch the application and view a list of available learning modules with their respective difficulty levels and completion status
- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want to view detailed information about each learning module including objectives, required commands, and expected outcomes
- **User Story 3**: As a user, I want to view command demonstrations and examples before attempting to execute them independently

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When the application is launched, a list of all available learning modules is displayed.
2. Each learning module shows:
    - Title
    - Difficulty level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
    - Completion status (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
3. Within the module detail view, users can access a "Demonstrations/Examples" section.
4. Each command in the module has at least one example or demonstration.
5. Demonstrations are presented in an accessible format (e.g., video, animation, step-by-step text with output).
6. The system clearly distinguishes between a demonstration and the userâ€™s practice environment (to prevent confusion).
7. If demonstrations are unavailable for a command, the system displays a message (e.g., "No demonstration available").
8. If no modules are available, a message is displayed (e.g., "No learning modules available").
9. Selecting a learning module from the list opens a detail view.
10. The detail view displays:
    - Module objectives (clear learning goals).
    - List of required commands/tools for the module.
    - Expected outcomes or skills gained upon completion.
11. Users can navigate back from the detail view to the module list.
12. If details are missing or unavailable, an error or placeholder message is displayed.
13.  Modules are displayed in a structured list format that is easy to navigate.
   
## Daily Scrum Framework
**Daily Standup Structure** (15 minutes max):
1. **What did I accomplish yesterday?**
2. **What will I work on today?**
3. **Are there any impediments or blockers?**

## Success Metrics (MVP Definition)
- **Functional**: User can complete 3 Git learning modules end-to-end
- **Educational**: Command demonstrations are clear and helpful
- **Technical**: Application starts in <3 seconds, handles errors gracefully
- **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation, clear progress indicators
- **Delivery**: Working demo ready by Monday morning with documentation
